In order to mint tokens, you will need to provide the wallet for which you want to mint the token.

Now, it's time to create a wallet that we will be using.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://protocol-sandbox.lumx.io/v2/wallets \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY'
```

```javascript JavaScript
axios.post("https://protocol-sandbox.lumx.io/wallets").then((response) => {
  // Handle Success
  console.log(response);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

You will receive a status 201 with an object containing the ID and the address for wallet.

**Congratulations!** You can check your wallet on the [block explorer](https://amoy.polygonscan.com). Just paste the wallet address in the search field.

You're now ready to start minting tokens using your contract and your newly created wallet.
