At the accounts level, we have the following terms to disclose:

* Client: you, our Lumx client, that has accepted to use our APIs.

* Customer: Users of your business.&#x20;

* Wallet: We provide wallets with flexible and powerful control over blockchain transactions and custom logic.

### Customers

Customers represent users of your business. By creating or updating your customers through our API you can enable seamless transfers of stablecoins or fiat currencies between your customer's wallets or bank accounts.&#x20;

We currently handle a soft KYC/KYB (Name, Tax ID, and Birth Date) for your users in compliance with legal requirements when using our on/off ramp processes.&#x20;

Deeper KYC/KYB options will be provided soon.&#x20;

### Wallets

Programmable wallets are ideal for applications requiring conditional transfers, complex multi-step blockchain interactions, special filters, or account recovery mechanisms, turning them into a key component that helps make blockchain accessible to regular “non-crypto-native” users.

* Multiple signing methods

We support multiple signing methods. You can either leverage our pre-build signers or bring your own signer depending on your custody model. You can use MPC or HSM for custodial wallet models or Passkeys for self-custodial.

* Gas management

To address the UX challenges of users needing to possess cryptocurrencies to cover transaction fees on blockchain networks, we provide an innovative gas management feature utilizing a “gas sponsorship” system, meaning we cover all gas costs for your transactions.&#x20;
